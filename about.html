    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Africa faces challenges like poverty, limited education, and healthcare, but solutions exist.
      Charities provide essentials like food, clean water, and shelter, build schools, and train teachers
      to improve education. In healthcare, they offer supplies, clinics, and education to prevent disease,
      creating healthier communities.
    </p>

    <h1>Achievements</h1>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ve provided clean water to thousands, built schools, and supplied clinics with medicines and
      vaccines to improve health. Our farming projects have trained farmers, boosting food security and
      economic growth. These efforts have made a lasting, positive impact in communities across Africa.
    </p>

    <h1>Our Values</h1>
    <p>These are the beliefs and principles that guide our organization and team.</p>
